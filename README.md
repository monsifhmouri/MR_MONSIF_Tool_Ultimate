# MR MONSIF Tool Ultimate

## Overview
Welcome to the **MR MONSIF Tool Ultimate**, a powerful and professional penetration testing tool exclusively designed for MR MONSIF. This tool is crafted to scan websites (e.g., Bugcrowd bounty targets) and identify ports, vulnerabilities, potential exploits (XSS, SQLi), and sensitive data (e.g., config.js, headers, tokens). It is secure, password-protected, and optimized for Kali Linux.

## Features
- **Port Scanning:** Uses Nmap and Masscan for comprehensive port discovery.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employs Nikto and Dirb to detect web vulnerabilities.
- **XSS/SQLi Detection:** Utilizes XSStrike for advanced XSS and SQL injection testing.
- **Sensitive Data Collection:** Gathers data like `config.js`, HTTP headers, and tokens (e.g., Mixpanel, Okta, Redocly).
- **Exploitation:** Attempts to exploit sensitive data for deeper insights.
- **Security:** Password-protected to ensure exclusive use by MR MONSIF.
- **Output:** Saves results as text files on the Desktop (e.g., `ports_*.txt`, `vulns_*.txt`).
